## Description

Pizza Hunt is a social media recipe app where users can post their creative spins on pizza, add comments to recipes, and create threads within comments. This application was created by following the steps of a course module on MongoDB, Mongoose, MongoDB Atlas, and Heroku. This app was created by adding back-end functionality to an existing front end.

## Usage

When you arrive at the Pizza Hunt Homepage you will see the Pizza recipes already created by users in the app. You can add your own recipe by clicking "create new pizza" or click to see the discussion on each pizza recipe. Users can add their own comments to pizza recipes and reply to other comments.
